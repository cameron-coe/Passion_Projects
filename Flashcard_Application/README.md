# Cameron Coe's Flashcard Application
This application lets users create decks, name them, create flashcards in each deck, take quizzes based on their flashcards, and save/load their decks and cards.
I started this project after being enrolled in Tech Elevator's Java Bootcamp for three weeks. I continued modifying and improving this project until the end of the program.

### Inspiration for this Project
I enjoy studying with flashcards, but haven't found any applications or websites that provide exactly what I was looking for. Since I was learning full stack development at Tech Elevator, I decided to make this application to help me study.

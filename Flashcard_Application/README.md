# Cameron Coe's Flashcard Application
This application lets users create decks of flashcards, organize them, and generate quizzes to help them study. After every update to the decks or flashcards, the software saves their data in a text file.
I started this project after being enrolled in Tech Elevator's Java Bootcamp for three weeks. I continued modifying and improving this project until the end of the program.

### Inspiration for this Project
I enjoy studying with flashcards, but haven't found any applications or websites that provide exactly what I was looking for. Since I was learning full stack development at Tech Elevator, I decided to make this application to help me study.
